## Coding Guidelines

### Frontend (TypeScript/React)

#### Type Safety

- **Never use `any`** in production code. Use `unknown` and narrow with type guards.
- All API payloads must be validated with runtime type guards.
- Use explicit interfaces for component props and shared data structures.

**Example Type Guard:**

```typescript
type JsonRecord = Record<string, unknown>;

function isRecord(value: unknown): value is JsonRecord {
  return typeof value === 'object' && value !== null;
}

function parseProject(value: unknown): { id: string; title: string } | null {
  if (!isRecord(value)) return null;
  const id = typeof value.id === 'string' ? value.id : '';
  const title = typeof value.title === 'string' ? value.title : '';
  if (!id || !title) return null;
  return { id, title };
}
```

#### Component Structure

- Keep components focused and single-purpose
- Extract repeated UI patterns into reusable components
- Use semantic class names over anonymous utility chains

#### Styling

- Short utility usage in TSX for one-off styles
- Long/repeated class chains go in SCSS classes under `src/styles/`
- Group styles by responsibility (base, components, layout, modals, views)
- Import styles only through `src/styles/index.scss` from `src/main.tsx`

#### Async Operations

- Keep file/system operations in `src/lib` wrappers
- UI components should call wrappers, not raw APIs

### Backend (Rust)

- Follow Rust standard conventions
- Use `cargo fmt` to format code: `just rustfmt`
- Handle errors properly with `Result<T, E>`
- Document public APIs with doc comments

### Code Formatting

Run formatters before committing:

```bash
# Format TypeScript/JavaScript/CSS
just format

# Format Rust
just rustfmt

# Format YAML
just yamllint
```

Or use the comprehensive check:

```bash
just check-all
```
